* fresnel

Inspired by /Naty Hoffman's/ presentation [[http://renderwonk.com/publications/mam2019/naty_mam2019.pdf][Fresnel Equations Considered Harmful]], the following plots compare the fresnel equations for dielectric and conductive materials against the /Schlick/ and /Lazányi-Schlick/ (re-parameterized by /Hoffman/) approximations, respectively.

The main point of /Hoffman's/ presentation is that the approximations might be an overall better choice for RGB-rendering, which is explained in great detail. 
My personal, simplistic, take-away is that the /Lazányi-Schlick/ approximation can be used to better model the "dip" in reflectivity of conductive materials compared to the /Schlick/ approximation.

** Dielectric

** Conductor
[[file:schlick_conductor.png]]

η and κ are the real and imaginary part of the complex Index of Refraction used for conductive materials.

** Renderings

The displayed images are rendered without caustics paths, because it makes the difference images easier to read. 
One reason is, that even with seemingly converged caustics, there still are a few very small areas with high difference, which just might be noise. This makes the difference due to fresnel appear less, relatively speaking.

Nonetheless images with caustic paths are accessible via the links below the images, as it is interesting to see the difference between the fresnel approximations manifest on indirectly lit surfaces.
