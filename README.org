* fresnel

Inspired by Naty Hoffman's presentation [[http://renderwonk.com/publications/mam2019/naty_mam2019.pdf][Fresnel Equations Considered Harmful]], the following plots compare the fresnel equations for dielectric and conductive materials against the /Schlick/ and /Lazányi-Schlick/ (re-parameterized by Hoffman) approximations, respectively.

The main point of Hoffman's presentation is that the approximations might be an overall better choice for RGB-rendering, which is explained in great detail. My personal, simplistic, take-away is that the /Lazányi-Schlick/ approximation can be used to better model the "dip" in reflectivity of conductive materials compared to the /Schlick/ approximation.

η and κ are the real and imaginary part of the complex Index of Refraction used for conductive materials.
